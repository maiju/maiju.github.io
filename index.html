		<h2>Improving Project Management System in R&amp;D with Human-Centered Design</h2>
		<h3>Master's thesis</h3>
		<p>The thesis aimed to understand project managers, their needs and usage of a project management system. The objective was to provide improvement suggestions of how the system could become more useful for the project managers. <br /><br />
		Human-centered design methods (contextual inquiry, questionnaire, idea workshops) were used to contribute to the understanding of users and their context of use, and the creation of supportive design solutions.<br /><br />
		The thesis was conducted for <a href="http://www.kemira.com/en/about-us/research-and-development/Pages/default.aspx">Kemira's R&amp;D organization</a> from May 2013 to Jan 2014.</p>

		<h2>Tulevala</h2>
		<h3>Concept created on course Information networks: Studio X</h3>
		<p>We created a concept which is aimed for high-school aged students and is a career simulation game. The name comes from Finnish words "tuleva" - future and "ala" - trade.<br/><br />
		The concept aims to help students in choosing their future study places and careers with the help of game environment which imitates real life work conditions. The concept was created to tackle the uncertainty of students and lack of knowledge of for example what does a M.Sc. (tech) or MBA really do. On society level, the benefit would be on reducing gap years and study place changes. The office simulation provides real experiences of the environment, work tasks and team work of a specific topic or  type of work. The concept focused on abstract academic jobs but could basically be expanded to any field.<br/><br />
		During concept development we were engaged in brainstorming, facilitated a prototype game with youngsters, and pitched our concept to audience.

		<h2>Information Visualization projects</h2>
		<h3>Interactive coursework  created during Information Visualization studies in Aalto MediaLab</h3>
		<p>During MediaLab courses I learned about different information visualization techniques. A few of the projects is presented below.
		<br/><br />
		My first project was together with students from photography and graphic design. In a very tight schedule, we created an interactive installation, which would be more complete when viewed in company. Small particles, triangles, were floating in a three dimensional space together with an irregular soundscape. When one person would view the installation, the particles would start to move in a more regulated way and the sound would have more structure. When more people joined, the sound and the movements would become more harmonized and synchronized. The idea was to create a beautiful installation which would be more meaningful when people notice that interaction makes a difference.
		<br/><br />
		Another project, the "Finance flow", was a gamified visualization concept of a finance questionnaire aimed for 15-20 year old youth. The client was National Consumer Research Center, and they were excited about a way to motivate the youth to get information about financial knowledge. 
		<br/><br />
		In yet another project, the aim was to use augumented reality in some simple way. Our little project aimed to increase the awareness of CO2 consumption by placing a marker in coffee cups. When the cup is viewed through a camera, an information popout would appear. When a person is drinking coffee from our cup, they would be virtually hit in their head with a Co2 footprint accompanioned with a smack sound. This was a fun awareness campain concept which was put together in a few days.

		<h2>Suns</h2>
		<h3>New internal and external website</h3>
		<p>The sailing club Suns needed a new website which would include a separate member site via login. I planned a new structure for both external and internal site together with the club board, and designed a new, updated look for the site. <br /><br />
		<a href="http://www.suns.fi">http://www.suns.fi</a> <br />
		<i>Notice:</i> The website functionality and design has been changed since this design was launched in 2011.</p>

		<h2>TuntuQ</h2>
		<h3>Concept created on course User Inspired Design, Aalto ARTS</h3>
		<p>The initial starting point for our concept was a question of "How to improve well-being through the sense of touch?" <br/><br />
		We created a product concept which is based on providing a set of different materials to stimulate the sense of touch. Half-moon shaped pieces are all compatible with each other and  provide different kinds of touching sensations especially for feet.<br/><br />
		During the design proccess, we used several idea creation methods, conducted expert interviews, created design probes and personas, and validated  concept with users.

		<h2>Fling a bug</h2>
		<h3>Game created during course Information Networks: Studio 4</h3>
		<p>The topic of the course was to give an introduction to computer graphics through creative group work in Processing environment. In one of the assignments we explored different kinds of interaction techniques.<br/><br />
		Our game, <i>Fling a bug</i>, is interacted through web camera and microphone. The idea is to protect a leaf in the center of the display from being eaten by bugs. Waving playmark in hand and using the &quot;shout tool&quot;  will help the player to fling bugs away from the leaf.<br/>
